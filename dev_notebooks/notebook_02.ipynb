    "  - \"We've established that our \"accuracy\" score is now a more meaningful score used for validation of a given model, but \"recall, precision, and F-statistic\" may be better indicators of whether the model is doing a \"good job\"\n",

    "Hyperparameters:\n",
    "  - AUC/ROC: Adjusting this threshold will help reduce false negatives (lecture #40)\n",
    "  - The true- and false-positive rates will change if we make adjustments to the threshold. In fact, in the present case that was the whole point of making the adjustment: We want to minimize our false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Log-Loss:\n",
    "  - Add one more model to improve upon log-loss?\n",
    "  - Yes, log loss can be used to compare models! https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/15760\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why SMOTE:\n",
    "  - We use SMOTE because we are very concerned with mislabeling the minority class (churned) as the majority class (has not churned)\n",
    "  - If we accidently commit a false negative , then we lose out on business and we lose out on a chance to see WHY that customer churned. It matters less if we mislabel those who have not churned(0) as those who will churn (1), because we'd like to be on the safe side to incentivize a customer to stay even if they're already happy.\n",
    "  - Why use log loss? Models with lower loss values generate probability estimates that are closer to the true values, and thus are likely to perform better on many metrics."

    "### Stakeholders:\n",
    "My stakeholders are the Customer Retention Analytics (CRA) team at a telecoms company \"SyriaTel\" where I'm a lead datascientist. The CRA team takes a data-driven approach to enhancing customer satisfaction and decreasing churn (when a customer leaves a business). I'm on a team within a centralized datascience and engineering organization. We support various satellite analytics teams including CRA, who distill our datasets further into business metrics, interactive dashboards, and slide deck presentations. The CRA team supports the greater customer retention org, which then implements changes to our incentives program. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem and Objective:\n",
    "We lack the ability to identify customers when they're on the cusp of churning. The objective of this project is to predict likely churners. Our dataset includes 20 variables describing over 3,000 current and churned customers. Achieving this predictive ability will allow us to examine the data on a rolling basis and quickly implement targeted incentivization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology:\n",
    "- We use a predictive logistic regression model rather than multiple linear regression because our target variable is categorical rather than numerical and continuous. The modeling process allows us to iteratively guide how the model \"learns\" about our data to improve the accuracy of its predictions. While using a machine learning model isn't \"better\" than simpler methods of getting at our problem such as SQL analysis, visualizations or EDA, we're focusing on a predictive modeling approach for now. We justify this prioritization because the sooner our CRA team has a customer list for targeted incentivizing, the better. Customer Retention can offer upgrades to those customers and prevent lost business before it occurs.\n",
    "- This buys us some time while we take a deeper dive into data cleaning, EDA, and inferential modeling. Those methods will complement our predictive model and help to fine-tune it by shedding light on the actual relationships between the data and to what extent a given variable is impacting churn. This way, our retention efforts will become more specific and strategic. Our aim is to strike a balance between preventing lost business and wasting money on extravagant incentives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "This project's methodology isn't geared towards identifying the specific variables causing churn and to what degree. However, the predicitve modeling approach is a sensible first step: we are swiftly preventing lost business as we take a deeper dive into the razor-precise correlations and causations of churn."

    "  - The reason for balancing etc. is actually because the misclassification costs are not equal, but this has nothing to do with the imbalance per se, it is just that imbalanced learning problems tend to be ones with obviously unequal costs. For example, I suspect it is a far worse error to classify a patient as not being at risk of stroke when they are (they may go home untreated, have a stroke and die) than to classify them as at risk of stroke when they are not (they will just be subjected to unnecessary further testing). We should be considering misclassification costs anyway, regardless of imbalance."
